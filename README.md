## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BLacika  
Full name: LÃ¡szlÃ³ SÃ¡ndor Balassa.  
I live in Budapest with my wife and 2-year-old son.  
I work for a company where i develop the company's own software, with Angular and Python (w/o framework).  
I am an accountant by qualification, but after 5 year of hobbyist programming, i managed to find a job as developer. That was my dream.  
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything that is developement.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Quasar Framework (Vue 3.0), Elixir and Phoenix.  
Now, as hobby project, i work on an invoicing app (really simple), with Queasar Framework. I'm planning to do that with Phoenix Framework.  
I have a few project in my repository. I created small Java apps to helping me in my accounting work.  
I created apps with Angular and Spring Boot to find a job. I found those really good.  
I would also like to get to know the Dotnet stack. I have heard and read good things about it.  
Learning Svelte is also on my bucket list. I really like its simplicity and the fact that it is compiled.
